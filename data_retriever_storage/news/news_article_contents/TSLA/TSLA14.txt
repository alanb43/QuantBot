Suze Orman might as well add laser eyes to her Twitter handle, as the new crypto social-media dictates. The celebrity financial adviser on Monday, during a CNBC interview, suggested that bitcoin 
        BTCUSD,
        -6.20%
       should be included in the mix of a sound investing portfolio. 
Orman told the business network that, “it’s a place to put some money and just leave it,” referring to the world’s No. 1 crypto. This isn’t the first time that Orman has waxed bullish on bitcoin and its like.  The money guru back in March told Yahoo Finance that she loves bitcoin. She said she had been purchasing shares of crypto bull MicroStrategy 
        MSTR,
        +0.75%,
       which has become a default proxy for the performance of bitcoin due to its frequent purchases of the digital asset on its balance sheet. She said then that she wouldn’t be investing in bitcoin, a highly volatile asset, unless she had money to lose.  Her comments on Monday come as bitcoin breached $40,000 for the first time in about three weeks, with crypto enthusiasts crediting a tweet from Tesla Inc.
        TSLA,
        +1.18%
       CEO Elon Musk for part of the boost to the digital asset.  At last check, bitcoin was trading up 4% at $39,949 on CoinDesk and has gained 36% so far in 2021.  By comparison, traditional investments have seen strong returns but not close to some of the best performing cryptos. The S&P 500 index 
        SPX,
        -1.14%
       booked its 29th record closing high of 2021 on Monday and is up over 13% during the period, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
        DJIA,
        -1.40%
       has climbed more than 12% and the Nasdaq Composite 
        COMP,
        -0.76%,
       which scored its first record close since April 26, is up 10% thus far in the year.
