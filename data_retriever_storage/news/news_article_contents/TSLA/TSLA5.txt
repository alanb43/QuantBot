An interesting stock market pattern has formed in 2021: Shares of global auto makers rise after the companies announce more capital spending on electric vehicles. Apparently, all any automotive management team needs to do to improve stock returns is spend larger and larger amounts on electric vehicles. If only it were that simple. The latest exhibit is 
        General Motors
       (ticker: GM). It announced an incremental $8 billion in spending on vehicle electrification on Wednesday. Its stock jumped 1.6% while the 
        Dow Jones Industrial Average
       and the 
        S&P 500
       fell. 
The $8 billion is on top of $27 billion that the company announced in November earmarked to be spent between then and 2025. While GM stock rose 0.2% on the day of that announcement, shares rose 3.3% on March 4 when CEO 
      Mary Barra
       announced the company’s original EV spending budget of $20 billion. Shares rose 3.4% on Jan. 28 when the company said it planned for its entire lineup to be electric by 2035.  Not to be outdone, 
        Ford Motor
       (F) announced roughly $20 billion in electric vehicle spending in February. Shares rose 1.2% the day of the announcement and its first-quarter earnings. Ford then increased the amount to be spent on vehicle electrification to about $30 billion on May 26. Shares rose 8.5% in response.   
Volkswagen
       (VOW.Germany) has plans to invest in its electric vehicle offerings too. Back in March, it increased long-term electric vehicle spending plans and outlined news plans to invest billions in its own battery capacity. Volkswagen shares rose about 23% the week of the news.  There are a few factors likely at work behind this pattern.  For starters, there is some electric vehicle-related froth in the market. And speculation tends to spread. 
        Tesla
       (TSLA) stock rose about 740% in 2020. Stock in Chinese electric-vehicle maker 
        NIO
       (NIO) rose more than 1,100%. Falling costs—along with rising profits at Tesla—convinced investors the future of personal transportation was electric. That made any electric vehicle news good news for traditional auto makers such as GM and Ford.   Wall Street is a transmitter of froth sometimes, too. More electric-vehicle spending has led analysts to increase their stock price targets and upgrade ratings.  After GM announced more spending Wednesday, Citigroup analyst Itay Michaeli said he sees a path to more than $100 a share for GM stock. Michaeli rates GM stock Buy. His official price target was recently $85 a share.  Thursday, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas reiterated his $120 bull case target for GM shares that is partly based on GM’s ability to transition to an electric vehicle maker and, potentially, an electric vehicle battery supplier. Jonas rates GM shares Buy and his base-case price target is $80 a share.  Back in March, Barclays analyst Brian Johnson upgraded Ford stock to Buy from Hold, partly because of more aggressive electric vehicle spending plans. His price target is currently $15  share.  Stocks tend to rise when analysts raise numbers and get more bullish. Ford stock is up 71% year to date. That isn’t too far off the 64% rise in the average analyst price target Wall Street has set for Ford stock. Ford stock’s target price has risen from roughly $9 to $15 a share so far in 2021.  There is also a fundamental reason auto stocks could be more valuable following capital spending announcements. What investors are saying, implicitly, when they bid up shares, is the EV spending will lead to better future cash flows. Capital spending pays for all the plants and equipment needed to generate sales.  Time will tell if car companies will return more to investors because vehicles are powered by batteries instead of gasoline. For now, the market is betting it is.
