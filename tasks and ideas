-remove non-alphanumerics from articles
-break the articles down by word to feed into sentiment analysis
-sentiment analysis algorithm
-get bot server live, always running
-create rules we want the bot to have (stop/sell %s)
-time analysis algorithm
-distinguish between time's shares and sentiment's shares
  -sentiment in the morning, time in the afternoon

- filter articles by number of times ticker is mentioned
      -> if AAPL is mentioned 1 time, the article isn't actually talking about it.
         we want to analyze articles that actually are specific to a stock, not just
         mentioning (maybe make it where we only keep articles with 3-4 + mentions)

LOGO
  - Q, inside is a robot that blinks into money signs
  - Quant with a robot next to it if Q is too small

WEBSITE IDEAS
  - news articles, "this article made us buy 10 shares of..."
  - webscrape alpaca, store values needed for website in a python file,
    link the python to the html


IDEA:

Remove side bar, have other stuff centered on site, when you scroll past what is quant bot
it starts showing our portfolio one by one of each stock, the info thats in sidebar (price, shares,
market value that we're holding, p/l, etc), as well as the most recent decision we made and the associated
reasoning (news article, time series analysis). This way it makes it more original (no more ripping from 
robinhood) and i feel like it would be super clean and make the website seem more populated with relevant info
