### Potential Summer Project Idea


##### We create a stock trading bot that utilizes a big brokerages API to buy/sell stock, based on a backend AI driver that is classifying news regarding the stocks and determining whether to buy/sell based on it. Could do this in a bunch of ways, could analyze news reports, could use indicators and trends, etc. I was thinking instead of making the bot have to find stock to buy/sell based on these indicators, we give it 10-15 stocks that it exclusively is learning about, and then is making decisions based on.
