# QuantBot.io

In this summer project, [Josh Cunningham](http://joshcunningham.net/) and [I (Alan)](https://bergsneider.dev/) will attempt to build an end-to-end stock trading bot. This may take longer than the summer to complete, and may be much more challenging than we're anticipating, however we'd like to create an application that scrapes the web for financial news and data related to the stock market, performs analysis on this information and data using machine learning / artificial intelligence, and then makes purchase / sell decisions on stock on it's own in order to derive a profit.

In the process of pursuing this goal, we aim to learn and use:
* Web Scraping
* Time series analysis
* Sentiment Analysis
* Cloud Services (GCP)
* Dynamic web application development
* Various analytics libraries in Python, front-end technologies

The end goal is to have a bot that operates completely on its own up the in the cloud, managing a joint portfolio for us. Information about the bot, its trades, and the portfolio will be found on QuantBot.io once this project is complete.
